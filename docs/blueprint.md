- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0F8FF), providing a gentle, unobtrusive backdrop to enhance readability and focus.
- Accent color: Royal blue (#4169E1), complementing the primary color and serving to highlight interactive elements, offers and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' for headlines (sans-serif, geometric), and 'PT Sans' for body text (sans-serif, humanist) for clarity and modern appeal.
- Use a consistent set of modern icons, with a filled style, to represent product categories and functionalities, enhancing the visual appeal without overwhelming the content.
- Implement a grid-based layout for both the e-commerce and learning portal sections, ensuring a clean, organized presentation that enhances the user experience.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., adding items to cart, completing a course module), creating a more engaging experience.
